## Acknowledgements

This guide would not have been possible without the work of Aeter's [data mining](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rbYbQ0i3SuTu30KTma5dO4uuJWr_SjOZXA1l4UOIHWo/htmlview?usp=sharing&sle=true&pru=AAABcjBrDv8*pYH043VrbN3tkoT0xjjErw). Please visit their spreadsheet for more detailed information (including technicalities) and additional resources. This is also where I got the inventory icons for each flower.

Big thanks to Kyro TV for their [guide on obtaining blue roses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NDWIqpju5k). There are many ways to obtain blue roses but majority of them are complex, multi-step processes. But Kyro TV's video explains one such way to obtain blue roses very clearly.

Credit to BackwardsN for their [compact breeding layout guide](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/694317725190717440/701714066611109928/image0.png). Most of my layouts are thanks to the help of their guide.
